# Travel Insurance Prediction
* This project was carried out with the aim to build and find Machine learning model that have good result to predict whether someone will buy Travel Insurance packages or not
* Because in imbalanced data condition, F1 score is the proper metric to measure the model performance

# Dataset Content
The dataset contains some information about :

# Data Cleaning
* Split dataset into Training and Test (70%:30%)
* Missing Values Checking 
* Duplicates Checking and Handling
* Outlier Checking
* Feature encoding
# Modelling
* Split Data training and test to X & y
* Use Oversamping and set threshold to handling imbalanced data
